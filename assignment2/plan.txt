Discussion on 19 August (Saturday)

We have to communicate with each other and one of us have to also act as a database
All would have the database for the line numbers so that the database guy is not overloaded with
requests.
The database person will keep both line number and line and others will keep only line number in their hashes


Could be done in java or python but right now we will use python (sockets)


Mani and Satyam cant connect also Rajat and Harshit can't connect using the code updated now.

One solution could be 
Mani  - Harshit 
Rajat - Satyam 
communicate with each other

and 
Mani - Rajat communicate with each other finally !

This only seems vialble as of now. But the problem will arise in case of bookkeeping the lines received.
